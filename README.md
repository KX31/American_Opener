# American_Opener

This openner is heavily inspired from Dev's Fire Plug: https://github.com/deviantollam/FirePlug.git

This one is small so it fit anywhere, but needs a pick or 1/4" hex driver to activate.
3D printed in PLA will last for dozens (if not hundreds) of openings.

Print vertical with no support 👍
